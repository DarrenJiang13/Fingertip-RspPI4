# Configuration Tutorial before Running code in Ubuntu 18.04 on PI4

**Attention: Architecture Difference ! ! !**
Our Laptop: **x86**
Raspberry Pi4: **arm**
This is useful when you want to choose some software.

## 1.Install Pylon
  - 1. Go to the [pylon software download](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/#type=pylonsoftware;language=all;version=all) site, and choose **More Downloads**, find [pylon-5-2-0-linux-arm-64-bit-debian](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/pylon-5-2-0-linux-arm-64-bit-debian/). If you download other pakage without an "arm" word in it, you wll not be able to install it in your Ubuntu 18.04 system. (refer to the Architecture Difference I mentioned before.)
